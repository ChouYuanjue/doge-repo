I'm sitting here in a boring room.
It's just another rainy Sunday afternoon.
I'm wasting my time, I got nothing to do.
I'm hanging around, I'm waiting for you.
But nothing ever happens, and I wonder.
I'm driving around in my car.
I'm driving too fast, I'm driving too far.
I'd like to change my point of view.
I feel so lonely, I'm waiting for you.
But nothing ever happens, and I wonder.
I wonder how, I wonder why.
Yesterday you told me about the blue, blue sky.
And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree.
I'm turning my head up and down.
I'm turning, turning, turning, turning, turning around.
And all that I can see is just another lemon tree.
I'm sitting here, and I miss the power.
I'd like to go out taking a shower.
But there's a heavy cloud inside my head.
I feel so tired, and put myself into bed.
Well nothing ever happens, and I wonder.
Isolation is not good for me, isolation I don't want to sit on the lemon tree
I'm stepping around in a desert of joy.
Baby, anyhow I get another toy.
And everything will happen, and you wonder.
I wonder how, I wonder why.
Yesterday you told me about the blue, blue sky.
And all that I can see is just another lemon tree.
I'm turning my head up and down.
I'm turning, turning, turning, turning, turning around.
And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree.
Yet I wonder, wonder,
I wonder how, I wonder why.
Yesterday you told me about the blue, blue sky.
And all that I can see,
And all that I can see,
And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree.
