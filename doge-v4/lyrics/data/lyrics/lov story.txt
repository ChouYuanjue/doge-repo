I'm standing there
Begging you please don't go
I'll be waiting all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story
We keep quiet cause we're dead if they knew
I was begging you please don't go
I'll be waiting all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story
Theyâ€™re trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult but it's real
Don't be afraid we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story
I've been feeling so alone
I don't know what to think
Marry me Juliet you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
It's a love story
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you
